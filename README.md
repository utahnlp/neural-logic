# Evaluating Relaxations of Logic for Neural Networks: A Comprehensive Study (IJCAI 2021)

We empirically study the differences between logic relaxations using two tasks: recognizing digits and arithmetic operations over them, and text chunking.

<!--### 1. Recognizing digits and arithmetic operations-->
